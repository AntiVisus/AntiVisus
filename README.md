Hey y'all. I literally have no idea why someone should be here,
reading this file and on my profile, but anyway.
I'm basically a beginner at programming, and my dream is making a good 
game that people can just play and enjoy.
I'm also a complete metalhead and I play guitar, and therefore, when (and if) I'll have some kind of 
good project, I also plan to make my own music.
